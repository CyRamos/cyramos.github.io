# One Telegram Message, One DDoS Group: What Can We Uncover?

## What Can We Learn from Cybercrime Forum Posts?
When browsing through cybercrime forums or encrypted messaging platforms, have you ever stopped to really examine what’s being shared? These posts—often written in coded language or filled with technical jargon—can contain a goldmine of information for investigators and analysts. But what exactly makes them so interesting? And more importantly, what kind of details can we extract from them to push an investigation forward?
In this post, we’ll take a closer look at real examples and break down how to interpret them, identify key indicators, and leverage their contents for deeper cyber threat intelligence.

## What Can a Random Telegram Message Reveal About a DDoS Group?
At first glance, a single Telegram message from a cybercrime channel might seem insignificant—just noise in a flood of chatter. But what if that message belongs to DXPLOITMY, a group known for orchestrating DDoS attacks? Could one post hold the key to understanding their operations, tactics, or even uncovering their infrastructure?

In this post, we’ll break down an actual message shared in a Telegram channel linked to DXPLOITMY. We’ll explore what makes it interesting, what clues it offers about the group’s activity, and how even a brief post can spark a deeper investigation.

## DXPLOITMY’s Role in the OpIsrael Timeline
The post is taken from the @DXPLOITMY Telegram channel.
We could notice the actions were mentioned as part of activities related to the OPIsrael event—mostly during April—and this specific attack was on 14 Jan 2025. (“OpIsrael is an annual coordinated cyber-attack where hacktivists attack Israeli government and even private websites with DDoS attacks and more.”)

## Verifying the Attack: Was the Website Really Down?
According to [check-host](https://check-host.net/check-report/223da56akbc5) report it does seem the servers were down on Tue Jan 14 07:40:58 UTC 2025, the same date @DXPLOITMY posted there post. I do want to mention that although the threat group published on Telegram that the website was "can’t be reached", this does not necessarily confirm a successful attack. In some cases, asset owners may detect the attack in advance and implement proactive blocking measures. These may include automated defenses or policy-based restrictions based on geographic location. As a result, the attacker may be denied access to the website and perceive it as offline, even though it remains operational. Second, the attack itself was on the subdomain and not for the whole website.
