If you're advising clients in the financial sector—especially those based in North America—one question should be front and center as we head into 2025: Which ransomware group poses the biggest threat this year? With threat actors constantly evolving, understanding the most active and dangerous groups is critical for proactive defense. In this post, we'll take a focused look at one such actor: `LockBit`. We'll explore why it's a top threat to financial organizations, break down its tactics and tools, uncover its dark web activity, and highlight key indicators defenders should monitor closely.

## The Rising Threat of Ransomware to the Financial Sector
Ransomware remains one of the most significant cybersecurity threats these days. Threat groups evolve their techniques and expand. Every year there’s a raise of victims with targeted attacks across various sectors, today we want to focus on the Financial sector.

## LockBit: A Leading RaaS Operator in 2024
One of the most active threat actor groups adopting new models, lowering the barrier to entry for new attackers and expanding the scope of ransomware operations. This model is called “Ransomware as a service” or RaaS. Raas supplied infrastructure to new players getting in and attacking from day one without having unique development skills. This threat actor is called ‘LockBit’ and they one of the most active actors these days. On the graph below there are the number of victims declared by the top three RaaS groups per month in Q1 of 2024.

## Industry Focus: Financial Sector Under Fire
At this point, we know the share of financial organizations worldwide hit by ransomware attacks from 2021 to 2024. We know LockBit is one of the most active ransomware actors using RaaS models to expand their activities and genes. We notice the United States, especially North America, is targeted number 1 by LockBit. Now, let's correlate our data even more and look into the top six industries
targeted by ransomware families in Q1 of 2024.

After we revealed that LockBit is one of the most active ransomware threat actors for the Financial industry, expanding and developing more every year, we have to understand how to defend our systems. For solving this we need to understand how the LockBit operator works on the surface.
